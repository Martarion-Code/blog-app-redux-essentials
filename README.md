# blog-app-redux-essentials
This is blog app that created by following redux essentials tutorial in their docs. It's contains every tutorial and I committed everytime I finished each tutorial.  The first time I commited, the tutorial already in part 4: Using Redux Data. So it's more like my learning tracker when I'm learning redux.
